Built on a site once slated for sale, it instead became a canvas for a regenerative home - one that treads lightly yet lives fully. Constructed with 40% less cement, and entirely free of plaster or tiles, the home uses hollow terracotta bricks to self-regulate temperature - remaining up to 8°C cooler in peak summers. Locally sourced materials - Sheesham, Babool, Kota stone, upcycled timber - ground the structure in its vernacular, while hand-crafted elements like brass joints and indigo-dyed mortar replace industrial finishes with natural nuance. The spatial design invites natural light into every room, and employs Bernoulli’s principle to create gentle cross-ventilation through corridors, jaali work, and opposing windows.`,
